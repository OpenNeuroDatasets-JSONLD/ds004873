**MAIN STUDY** <br />
This dataset consists of 40 healthy, right-handed participants (sub-p019 to sub-p068) (see participants.tsv file) + 7 discarded participants. <br />
* sub-p022: behavioral (MEM) data not good, skipped nearly all keywords  <br />
* sub-p024: contrast agent did not reach participant! No CBV data <br />
* sub-p025: contrast agent did not reach participant! No CBV data <br />
* sub-p042: CBF maps are one-sided /unilateral <br />
* sub-p053: unilateral data in T2* calc  <br />
* sub-p056: movement artifacts/ringing, unilateral data in T2* calc <br />
* sub-p062: huge susceptibility artifacts above ear canals, did therefore not acquire contrast-agent CBV data <br />
(sub-p041, sub-p045, sub-p057 did not show up /cancelled short-notice. These participants were skipped completely without any data acquisition done.) <br />
<br />
<br />
**CONTROL STUDY**  <br />
This dataset consists of 18 healthy, right-handed participants (sub-dp007 to sub-dp024); T1w and fMRI BOLD data only (see control_participants.tsv file)  <br />
<br />
<br />
**REPLICATION STUDY**  <br />
This dataset consists of 10 healthy, right-handed participants  (sub-r021, sub-r054, sub-r059, sub-r060, sub-r070, sub-r071, sub-r072, sub-r073, sub-r074, sub-r075), see replication_participants.tsv file  <br />
